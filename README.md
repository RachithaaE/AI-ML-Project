# AI-ML-Project
#  ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on their preferences using Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering, with a user interface built using Streamlit.
#  Objective:
To develop a smart movie recommendation system using machine learning that:
- Suggests top 5 movies to a user based on past preferences.
- Utilizes both collaborative and content-based filtering approaches.
- Presents results through an interactive web interface.
# ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- MovieLens dataset
#  Dataset Used:
[movies.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21473206/movies.csv) ,
[ratings.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21473213/ratings.csv)

# Project Implementation Steps :

Loaded movie & rating datasets using Pandas.

Cleaned and merged data.

Content-Based Filtering with TF-IDF + cosine similarity.

Collaborative Filtering using KNN on user-item matrix.

Built UI with Streamlit to show recommendations.

 Tested the app using streamlit run app.py
